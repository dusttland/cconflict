# C-Conflict

What we do: We are creating a platform that can be used by humanitarian organizations to prioritize aid delivery to affected populations

How do we do it: We apply satellite data to identify areas that have experienced changes in infrastructure as a result of destruction in a short period of time. By comparing Capernicus pre-event and post-event satellite data, we can identify the destruction of specific buildings and damaged areas.

Used by: Humanitarian organizations, in particular organizations that donâ€™t have exciting access to satellite information. The provision of humanitarian assistance will be provided at first in the areas that have experienced most damage.
