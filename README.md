# C-Conflict

## Context

#### What we do
We are creating a platform that can be used by humanitarian organizations to prioritize aid delivery to affected populations.

#### How do we do it
We apply satellite data to identify areas that have experienced changes in infrastructure as a result of destruction in a short period of time. By comparing Capernicus pre-event and post-event satellite data, we can identify the destruction of specific buildings and damaged areas.

#### Used by
Humanitarian organizations, in particular organizations that donâ€™t have exciting access to satellite information. The provision of humanitarian assistance will be provided at first in the areas that have experienced most damage.
